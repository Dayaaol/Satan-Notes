Programming Basics:
==================
Basics:
	This sheet is basically about common concepts shared among different languages.
String Representations:
	Basics:
		Encoding:
			Encoding refers to converting characters into bytes.
		Decoding:
			Encoding refers to converting bytes into characters.
	Encoding Schemas:
		ASCII:
			ASCII has a huge short-coming, ie, it's numerical value can only define 256 characters originally, its not enough to represent characters such as accented characters, Chinese characters, etc.
			ASCII is represented by 8 bits.
		Unicode:
			Unicode includes representations for punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, and dingbats, with substantial room for future expansion.
			Therefore, Unicode was developed as it can represent upto 1,111,998 characters.
			Types:
				UTF+8:
					Minimum length of bits to represent a character is 8.
				UTF+16:
					Minimum length of bits to represent a character is 16.
