Programming Languages:
	Classification:
		Low Level vs High Level:	
			Low Level:
				Code is converted to opcodes through the compilation process and executed directly by the CPU.
				Low Level code is known as UnManaged code:
					Applications written in low-level languages must perform their own memory management, so its called UnManaged Code.
				Examples:
					C
					C++
						Its concidered both low level and high level
			High Level:
				Examples:
					Python
					JS
					PowerShell
					Bash
				ByteCode based Languages:
					Code from Java and C# is compiled into bytecode which is then processed by an installed virtual machine:
						Java:
							Java uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine), which is part of the JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
						C#:
							C# uses CLR(Common Language Runtime), which is part of the .NET framework
					Code produced by high-level languages that uses a virtual machine for execution is known as managed code as VM provides memory management.
		Compiled vs Interpreted:
			Compiled Language:
				Code written in a Compiled Language converts to binary before it can be executed
			Interpreted Language:
				Code written in a Interpreted Language is known as a script and it is converted into the required binary file format one line at a time when executed
