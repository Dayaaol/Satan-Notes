Heap for Pentesting:
===================
Basics:
	Uses:
		Its used a long-term data storage.

Starts right after BSS, during the execution the program can request more space in memory via brk and sbrk system calls, used by malloc(memory allocate) and realloc(re-allocate) and free. Hence, the size of the data region can be extended; this is not vital.
The heap segment is a pool of memory used for dynamically allocated memory, such as with malloc() in C or new in C++ and Java.

Structure in Memory:
	A Heap grows upwards, from lower memory address to upper memory address.
