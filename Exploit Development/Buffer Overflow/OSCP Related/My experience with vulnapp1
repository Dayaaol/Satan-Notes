My experience with vulnapp1:
===========================
Mainly i had issues with finding badchars bcoz of false postives by mona. 
It only had one false positive, ie "/x00"
But mona showed "00 to 08" and everytime i used to remove one badchar from the script, it used to add one.
its status is weird too:
	"Corruption after 0 bytes"
