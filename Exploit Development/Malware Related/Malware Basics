Malware Basics:
==============
Basic
	Terms:
		Encoding:
		Encryption:
		Obsfucation:
		Embedding:
	Shells:
		Basics:
			Shell Types:(2)
				A. Reverse Shell:
				B. Bind Shell:
		Note:
			Read Shells Sheet to read about creating shells and more.
	Payloads:(aka Droppers)
		Basics:
			Using Metasploit/C2 Frameworks like Empire/custom code/github tools, we get raw payload.
		Types:(2)
			Staged Payloads:
				Basics:
					They contain a minimal amount of code that performs a callback using a callback function to retrieve the remaining code and executes it in the target’s memory, so, it can be said that it send payload in stages, thats why its called staged payload.
					We need to use multi/handler with staged payloads and We cannot use Netcat with staged payloads.
				Advantages:
					Less memory as compared to a non-staged payload
					May evade AV
				Disadvantages:
					Lesser stability as compared to Stageless payloads.
				Example:
					MSF => windows/shell/reverse_tcp
			Stageless Payloads:(aka Non-Staged Payload)
				Basics:
					It contains all the code needed to open up a reverse command shell to an attacker’s machine.
				Disadvatages:
					Due to its large size, it may get caught by AV.
				Example:
					Netcat
					MSF => windows/shell_reverse_tcp
	Weaponization:
		Process of creating a torjan from a payload.
Malware:(Malicious Software)
	Basics:
	Types:(14)
		1. Virus:
			Basics:
				Its a program that replicates itself to spread without permission or knowledge of owner.
			Types:(4)
				A. Resident Type:
					Those viruses which become a memory resident when they are executed. In memory, they reside untill they are triggered by some trigger, such as opening of other programs, etc.
				B. Non-Resident Type:
					Those viruses which serach for files to infect once they are executed. 
				C. Boot-Sector virus:
					Virus which spreads via boot sectors
				D. Multi-Partite Type:
					Virus which has several types of infection mechanisms in itself such as both resident and boot-sector type virus
		2. Torjan Horse:(aka Torjan)
			Basics:
				A piece of code which looks safe to execute from outside, but do malicious acts when executed.
			Types:(2)
				A. Traditional Torjan:
					They embed an entire payload
				B. Mordern Torjan:(aka Dropper Torjan)
					They rely on a staged payload with a Callback function that connects back to the attack machine to download the second stage
		3. RootKit:
			Basics:
				Its basically used as a supplement to other malware. They are used to hide processes/files, create loopholes,etc.
				They are basically installed as drivers or kernel modules
			Types:
				Application Level:
					They replace actual program with copies of other malicious program
				Library Level:
					They take control of some library which is being used by diff programs
				Kernel Level:
				Hypervisor Level:
					They affect virtualization
				Firmware Level:
					Rootkits which affect firmware of device.
		4. BootKit:
			Its a type of rootkit which grab the OS during boot process
		5. BackDoor:
			Its a modification to a software meant to provide remote access while trying to remain hidden.
		6. AdWare:
			They display Ads time to time.
			Some adware can act as spyware
		7. GreyWare:
			Collection of Adware and Spyware
		8. RansomWare:
			It basically encrypts Password files(such as SAM) and demands a ransom for public key to decrypt the data in order to use the computer
		9. SpyWare:
			Its used to spy on user.
		10. Key-Logger:
			Basics:
				It logs the key strokes
			Types:(5)
				A. Software Key-Logger:
				B. Hardware Key-Logger:
					Firmware based keyloggers which can be put in BIOS
				C. Wireless Keyboard Key-Logger:(aka Wireless Keyboard Sniffer)
				D. Acoustic Key-Logger:
					Keyloggers based on sound which is produced when a user presses a key
				E. Optical Key-Logger:
					It is a type of Shoulder-Surfing.
					Basically, a Human or a Camera looks at u typing on the keyboard
		11. Botnet:
			It refers to a collection of compromised computers which run commands automatically and autonomously via a C2 server.
		12. Worm:
		13. Data-Stealing Malware:
		14. Implant:
