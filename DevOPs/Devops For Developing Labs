Devops For Developing Labs:
==========================
Basics:
	Terms:
		DevOps:
			It is the process to build/modify/deploy systems for Development.
Ansible:
	Basics:
Docker:
	Basics:
Packer:
	Basics:
		Packer allows you to automate the installation of the operating system and can make configuration changes to the operating system as well. 
		Packer is responsible for taking an operating system ISO and JSON configuration file as input, and generating a .box file as output. "file.box" is essentially a compressed version of a VM.
Terraform:
	Basics:
vagrant:
	Basics:
		Vagrant works on top of VMware/VirtualBox and it is sort of a cli client for VMware/VirtualBox.
		It uses Vagrantfiles, they contain information about VM, such as which os to use, the CPU/memory specifications, networking options, and also any scripts or commands that the VM should execute. Vagrant is also able to automate process of installing softwares on .Box files.
	Installation:
		Step-1:
			Download vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads and install it.
			Note:
				Make sure that "vagrant" is available via cmd. If it is not, then:

		Step-2:
			Download Vagrant "Utility"(.msi) for VMware/VirtualBox via https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware/downloads and install it.
		Step-3:
			Install the Vagrant "Plugin" for VMware/VirtualBox:
				CMD> vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
	Usage:
		vagrant up –provider=vmware_desktop => Bring up all Detection Lab hosts using VMware
		vagrant up <hostname> => Bring up a specific host
		vagrant reload <hostname> => Restart a specific host
		vagrant reload <hostname> –provision => Restart a specific host and re-run the provision process
		vagrant destroy <hostname> => Destroy a specific host
		vagrant destroy -f => Destroy the entire Detection Lab environment
		 	-f => Force => No prompt
		vagrant ssh logger => SSH into a host (only works with Logger)
		vagrant winrm –command hostname –shell powershell <hostname> => Run a WinRM command on a host (only works with DC, WEF, and WIN10)
		vagrant status => Check the status of each host
		vagrant suspend => Suspend the lab environment
		vagrant resume => Resume the lab environment
		vagrant halt => Shutdown each host
		Flags:
		Note:
			When running Vagrant commands, you must be in a directory containing a Vagrantfile or you will receive the following error:
				A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this command.
		Note:
			If you happen to have both Virtualbox and VMware Workstation/Fusion installed, it may be helpful to set the VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER environment variable to either vmware_desktop or virtualbox.
