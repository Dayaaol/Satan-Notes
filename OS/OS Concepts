OS Concepts:
===========
Basics:
	Terms:
		OS:(Operating System)
	OS Development History & Time-Line:
		UNIX Based OS:
			Read Linux Internals Sheet
	OS Types:
OSAL:(OS Abstraction Layer)(aka OS Abstraction Levels)
	Basics:
		Terms:
			Abstraction:
				Abstraction refers to ignoring the internal structure and working of a piece of code and focusing on the functionality of that code instead.
	Layers:(Hierarchy goes from A to C)
		A. Hardware:
			Read Hardware Sheet
		B. Kernel:
			Basics:
				Kernel is the core of OS. It resides in memory and act as a mediator between hardware and any running program.
				Terms:
					Kernel Mode:
						Kernel runs in Kernel Mode. This mode allows unrestricted access to the processor and main memory.
					Kernel Space:
						Memory area that only the kernel can access is known as Kernel Space.
			Components:(4)
				1. Process Management:
					Basics:
						Terms:
							Time Slice:
								A unit of time used by CPU to perform a computation.
							Multi-Tasking:
								It refers to being able to run multiple processes together. OS do so by pausing a process after running it for a 'time slice' and then running another process, and then resuming the first process.
					Context Switching:
				2. Memory Management:
					Basics:
						Terms:
				3. Device Drivers and Management:
					Device Drivers:(aka Drivers)
						Basics:
							Driver is a computer program that allows OS to operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer
						Types:
				4. System Calls:(SYSCalls)
					Basics:
						A system call is a procedure that provides the interface between a process and the operating system. It is the way by which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system.
					Linux SYSCalls:
						Read Linux Internals Sheet.
					Windows SYSCalls:
						Read Windows Internals Sheet.
			Interface:
				Basics:
					An interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. This boundary can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, and combinations of these.
				Types:(3)
					Hardware Interface:
					Software Interface:
					User Interface:
		C. User Process:
			Basics:
				User Process are programs that the kernel manages.
				Terms:
					User Mode:
						User Processes run in User Mode. This mode has restricted access to the processor and main memory.
					User Space:(aka Userland)
						Memory area that the user processes can access is known as User Space.
					Owner:
						Every user-space has a user owner and the processes in that user-space are said to run as the owner.
				Note:
					"User" in "User Process" has no particular meaning. It doesnt if a user directly iteracts with a program or not.
