Data Communication:
==================
Basics:
	Types:(2)
		A. Data Exfilteration:(aka Data Harvesting)(aka Pillaging)
			Victim sends data to attacker.
		B. Data Infilteration:
			Attacker sends data to victim.
Data Exfileration:
	Spying:

		Keylogging:
			Meterpreter:
				keyscan_start => Start keylogger
				keyscan_dump => Print keystrokes
				keyscan_stop => Stop keylogger
Data Exchange:(Applicable to both Infilteration/Exfileration)
	Basics:
	TTPs:
		Data Channels:(aka Channel)
			Basics:
				Data channel refers to mode of communication via which data can be sent or recieved.
				Ideal Channel:
					Covert:
						Either No/Minimal logging or a lot of logging(hide in between the logs)
					Reliable
					Efficient:
						Large data transmission
			Important Data Channels:
				DNS Exfilteration:(aka DNS Data Exfilteration)
					Basics:
						Advantages:
							Either incoming or outgoing DNS is never blocked.
						Disadvantages:
					Types:(2)
						A. High Throughput DNS Exfilteration:(aka DNS Tunneling)
							Note:
								DNS "Tunneling" is not same as "Tunneling(Port Forwarding)".
							Basics:
								DNS Tunneling refers to creating an interactive bi-directional communication channel on top of DNS
							Tools:
								Iodine:
									Basics:
										Its commonly used to use wifi without paying for it by using it over DNS.
									Usage:
								DNS2TCP:
									Basics:
										Its commonly used for file transfers over DNS.
									Usage:
								DNSCat:
									Basics:
									Usage:
						B. Low Throughput DNS Exfilteration:
							Basics:
								This technique is uni-directional & non-interactive as data is sent via independent small queries.
							Working:
								Lets say i have a shell on victim's system and i make ping requests to anything.xyz.com, in which "anything" is actually juicy data and "xyz.com" is a domain owned by me. So i will recieve data in form of DNS requests actually, for example:
									password1.xyz.com
									<encoded_password>.xyz.com

		Encoding:
			Linux:
				cat file.ext | base64 -w0 => Encoding
				cat file.ext | base64 -d => decoding
			Windows:
				certutil -encode filename.ext output.ext
				certutil -decode filename.ext output.ext
