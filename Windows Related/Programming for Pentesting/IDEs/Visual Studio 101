Compling, Running and Debugging:
	Debugging:
		In Debugging mode, VS runs the program until the program encounters an error and when an error is encountered, VS pauses the program and shows the problem.
	Release Mode:(Run with Debbuging)
		It is useful in case our program closes in a split second after running. "Run with Debugging" makes the program pause before closing. This option is also known as Release Mode.
