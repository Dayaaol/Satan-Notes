			3. Joining WS-01 & WS-02 to DC01:
				Networking:
					Step-1: In DC01:
						Network & internet settings -> Change adapter settings -> double click @ethernet -> properties -> double click IPv4 -> 
							IP => 10.120.116.75
							Subnet => 255.255.255.0
							Gateway => 10.120.116.1
							Preffered DNS => 127.0.0.1
							Alternate DNS => 8.8.8.8
					Step-2: In WS-01:
						CMD> ipconfig => identify 10.120.116.0/24 IP and Ethernet adapter name 
						Network & internet settings -> Change adapter settings -> double click @<ethernet adapter name> -> properties -> double click IPv4 -> 
							IP => 10.120.116.10
							Subnet => 255.255.255.0
							Gateway => 10.120.116.1

		Security Onion 2:(CentOS)
			Basics:
				Used for threat hunting. To catch the attacks i put against AD
			Features:
				ELK Stack:
					Elasticsearch:
						Its a search and analytics engine.
					Logstash:
						Its a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to Elasticsearch.
					Kibana:
						Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.
				Suricata:
					Feautures:
						HIDS => Host IDS
						IPS
				Zeek => Metadata analysis
				Wazuh => EDR
				Yara:
					A language to creates rules to catch malware. Using yara, i define patterns. Its kind off like regex.
				OSQuery:
					Osquery uses SQL tables to represent abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events, and file hashes. So, i can collect data using sql queries via osquery.
				Fleet:
					Provides frontend to osquery.
			Requirements:(Min)
				CPU Cores => 4
				RAM => 16 GB
				Storage => 200 GB

	HTB:
		Endgames:(Free)
			Endgames can't be normally accessed without achieving at least "Guru rank" in Hack The Box, which is only achievable after finishing at least 90% of the challenges in Hack The Box. This includes both machines and side CTF challenges. This can be a bit hard because Hack The Box keeps adding new machines and challenges every single week. However, once you're Guru, you're always going to be Guru even if you stopped doing any machine/challenge forever.
		Prolabs:(Paid)
			Isolated Network
			A. Dante:(Begineer)
				Hosts => 14
				Topics:
					OSCP-level BOF
					Pivoting
			B. OffShore:(intermediate)
				Begineer friendly
				Description:
					You are an agent tasked with exposing money laundering operations in an offshore international bank. Breach the DMZ and pivot through the internal network to locate the bank’s protected databases and a shocking list of international clients. OFFSHORE is designed to simulate a real-world penetration test, starting from an external position on the internet and gaining a foothold inside a simulated corporate Windows Active Directory network. Users will have to pivot and jump across trust boundaries to complete the lab. This lab is intended to expose participants to:
				Prerequisite:
					Networking
					Webapp
					AD
					Lateral movement and crossing trust boundaries
					Reverse Engineering
					Evading endpoint protections
				Hosts => 21
				Topics:
					Pivoting
					C2
				Ease of reset: The lab gets a reset automatically every day
				Support:
					Discord community
			C. Rastalabs:(Hard)
				RastaLabs is designed to simulate a typical corporate environment, based on Microsoft Windows systems. Elements include Active Directory (with a Server 2016 functional domain level), Exchange, Internet Information Services, SQL Server, and Windows 10 workstations. Machines are also segregated across multiple subnets.
				Prerequisite:
					1. Solid understanding of red teaming/penetration testing or blue teaming/security administration of AD environment.
					2. Solid formality with Active directory and PowerShell scripts.
					2. All machines are AV Patched and your exploit won’t save you :(
				Hosts:
					Amount => 15
					AV Patched Server 2016 and Windows 10
				Topics:
					OSINT and Phishing
					Token Impersonation
					Lateral movement and Pivoting
					Attacking kerberos
					Persistence techniques
					Patience & perseverance + Creative thinking
				Ease of reset: The lab does NOT get a reset unless if there is a problem! The reason being is that RastaLabs relies on persistence!
				Support:
					Contact rastamouse on discord. 
				Synopsis:
					Rastalabs is not a begineer-friendly lab

			D. Cybernetics:(Advanced)
				Includes linux AD too
				Hosts => 28
				Topics:
					Active Directory enumeration and exploitation
					Breakout
					Evading endpoint protections
					Kerberos abuse
					Lateral movement
					Phishing
					Privilege escalation
					Web application attacks
			E. APTLabs:(Advanced)
				Hosts => 18
	Vulnhub:
		WINTERMUTE-1:
			It involves 2 vulnerable machines
			This lab makes use of pivoting and post exploitation
			any necessary password cracking can be done with small wordlist
			Virtual Box Lab setup instructions are included in the zip download, but here's a quick brief:
				Straylight - simulates a public facing server with 2 NICS. Cap this first, then pivot to the final machine. Neuromancer - is within a non-public network with 1 NIC. Your Kali box should ONLY be on the same virtual network as Straylight.
			Note:
				This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware

		BOREDHACKERBLOG_SOCIAL-NETWORK:(v1)
			Leave a message is a new anonymous social networking site where users can post messages for each other. They've assigned you to test their set up. They do utilize docker containers. You can conduct attacks against those too. Try to see if you can get root on the host though.
			Difficulty: Med
			Tasks involved:
				port scanning
				webapp attacks
				code injection
				pivoting
				exploitation
				password cracking
				brute forcing
			Note:
				This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware.

		BOREDHACKERBLOG_MORIARTY-CORP:(v2)
			Web panel is on port 8000 (not in scope. Don’t attack)
			Flags are stored in #_flag.txt format. Flags are entered in flag{} format. They're usually stored in / directory but can be in different locations.
			To temporarily stop playing, pause the VM. Do not shut it down.
			The webapp starts docker containers in the background when you add flags. Shutting down and rebooting will mess it up.
			(the story is bad. sorry for the lack of creativity)
			Difficulty: Med-Hard
			Tasks involved:
				port scanning
				webapp attacks and bug hunting
				pivoting (meterpreter is highly recommended)
				password guessing/bruteforcing
			Note:
				This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware.

		NULLY CYBERSECURITY_1:
			This is an easy-intermediate realistic machine.
			While working with the machine, you will need to brute force, pivoting (using metasploit, via portfwd), exploitation web app, and using searchsploit.
			Hints: 'cat rockyou.txt | grep bobby > wordlist' for generating wordlist.
			Difficulty: Easy-intermediate
			Note:
				This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
