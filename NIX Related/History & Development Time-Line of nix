History & Development Time-Line of *nix:
=======================================
Organizations Involved:
	GNU:
	POSIX:(Portable Operating System Interface)
		Basics:
			POSIX is a family of standards released in 1988 specified by IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between Unix-Like OS, Microsoft Windows, DOS and OS/2 respectively.
OS History:
	MULTICS:(Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)
		MULTICS is a Time-Sharing OS based on concept of SLS(Single Level Storage) developed in 1964 as a cooperative project led by MIT along with GE and Bell Labs at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
	UNIX:(Uniplexed Information and Computing Service)
		Basics:
		Time-Line:
			UNIX was developed by AT&T in 1969 at Bell Labs.
			AT&T licensed UNIX to other parties in 1970s which lead to production of BSD, Xenix, Solaris, HP-UX and AIX.
			AT&T sold UNIX to Novell in 1990s. Novell then sold UNIX to SCO in 1995 and Novell owns UNIX copyrights to this date.
			However, UNIX trademark passed on to "The Open Group" in 1996 which allowed use of UNIX by anyone as long as the OS comply with SUS(Single Unix Specification)
		Versions:
	UNIX Derivatives:
		PWB/UNIX:(aka PWB)(aka Programmer's Workbench)
		BSD:(Berkeley Software Distribution)(aka Berkley Standard Distribution)
			Basics:
				BSD is a discontinued OS developed by University of California, Berkley.
			BSD Derivatives:
				OpenBSD:
				FreeBSD:
				NetBSD:
				DragonFly BSD:
				MINIX:(Minial Unix)
					It was developed by Andrew Tanenbaum as a minimal Unix-like OS in 1987.
		Xenix:
		Solaris:(aka SunOS)
	Linux:(aka GNU/Linux)
		Basics:
			Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds as an alternative of MINIX.
			Linux Kernel is completely different from Unix kernel.
