Red-Teaming:
===========
Basics:
	Red-Teaming is pentesting but with additional stealth and detection evasion.
	Terms:
		Threat Actor:
			An Adversarry.
			For example:
				APT-19 => Chinese 
		Red Team:
			Practice of looking at a problem or situation from the prespective of an Adversary(opponent). The Adversary role is given to a Red Team by the internal team of an organization via Threat Intelligence
			We attack:
				People
				Process
				Technology
			In Penetration Testing, we only attack "Technology"
		Adversary Emulation:
			Its a type of Red Team exercise where the red team emulates(acts) like an Adversary(opponent) following the same TTPs(Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) with an objective similiar to those of realistic threats. 
		ATT&CK:(Adversary Tactics Techniques & Common Knowledge)
			Made by MITRE
			A red-team framework/methodology
		Intelligence:
			Process of Collecting and processing information about an entity and its agents by a group
		Threat Intelligence:
			It is evidence-based knowledge including context, mechanism, indicators, implications and actionable advice about an existing or emerging hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that hazard.
Red Team Infrastructure:
	Basics:
		Basic Terminology:
			Agent:
				aka Implant/BackDoor
				Connection made when a Torjan is executed on victim's system
		Graphical Overview:
			       -> SMTP Server
			Hacker -> C2 Server      <-> C2 Redirector      <-> Target
			       -> Payload Server <-> Payload Redirector <-> Target
		SMTP Server:
			To send Phishing Mails
			During a Red-Team assesment, we can send a mail by either of the following ways:
				1. Self-Setup:
					Setting up our own server to send the phishing emails
					Options:
						Sendmail:
						Postfix:
							Advantages:
								Postfix provides an easier alternative to sendmail with wider compatiblity.
								Postfix also offers full IMAP support with Dovecot. This allows testers to correspond in real-time with phishing targets who respond to the original message, rather than relying on the catch-all address and having to create a new message using your phishing tool.
							Setup:	
								https://blog.inspired-sec.com/archive/2017/02/14/Mail-Server-Setup.html
					Obtaining Reputation to be allowed to mail and not go to spam:
						Plan around 30 days to gain reputation and be able to send email from your server to the target
						Every self-setup SMTP server should be configured with DKIM, SPF, and PTR records:
							DKIM:(DomainKeys Identified Mail)
								Its an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails (email spoofing), a technique used in phishing and spam. DKIM allows the receiver to check that an email claiming to come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the domain owner.
							SPF:(Sender Policy Framework)
								Its an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails.
								SPF allows the receiver to check that an email claiming to come from a specific domain comes from an IP address authorized by that domain's administrators. The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the DNS records for that domain.
							PTR:(Pointer DNS record)
								Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name isreturned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD.
				2. Third Party:
					Example => gmail
				3. Open Relay:
		C2 Server:(Command and Control)
			Read in C2 Frameworks Section below
		Payload Server:(Domain)
			It hosts payloads(Agents/RATs)
			Its mostly a webserver
			Getting a Domain:
				Buying a Domain:
					We need a domain which has "reputation", so that it dont get blacklisted automatically.
					Buying an Expired Domains:
						We can buy expired domains and they also have pre-built repuatation
						Domain Hunter:
							Automated tool to find domains based on reputation
							python3 ./domainhunter.py -r 1000 -c
							python3 ./domainhunter.py -r 1000 -k dog -c
								Flags:
									-r => show top 1000 expired domains	
									-k => domains having the particular keyword
									-c => perform domain reputation checks
					Buying a new Domain:
						Chameleon:(https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/Chameleon)
							Usage:
								Flags:
									--domain => domain to validate
									--check => peform check on current category
									--proxy x:
										a => all
										b => bluecoat
										m => mcafee
										i => IBM Xforce
					Note:
						Consider choosing a domain categorized as Finance or Healthcare as Many organizations will not perform SSL middling on those categories due to the possibility of legal or data sensitivity issues.
						It is also important to ensure your chosen domain is not associated with any previous malware or phishing campaigns.
				TLS Certificate:
					Why:
						1. To encrypt all C2 communication
						2. Some organizations only allow HTTPS
					Free:
						LetsEncrypt:
			Phishing Setup:		
		Redirector Server:(aka Redirectors)
			Basics:
				The Agents talk directly to Redirectors.
				Redirectors are used to forward traffic to back-end infrastructure(C2 server and Payload Server), basically acting like a proxy.
				Why do we use a Redirector?
					The goal is to always have a host between our target and our backend servers. So, if blue team blocks our ip, we can again set up a Redirector instead of a C2 server or a Payload server.
			We use two different Redirectors:
				1. Redirector for C2 Server:(C2 redirection)
					They are used in front of every C2 server (backend server) to obfuscate the backend C2 servers and confuse the blue
				2. Redirector for Payload Server:(Payload redirection)(Web Redirectors)
					Payload redirectors should be used in front of all servers hosting your social engineering payloads
					Types:
						Dumb Pipe:
							They take traffic from one port and proxy it to another ip and port
							No filering takes place
							Example => socat/iptables/netsh
						Filtering:
							It redirects each request based on filters
							Examples => Apache mod_rewrite/nginx

			Digital Ocean:
				https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/build-c2-infrastructure-digital-ocean-part-1/
			Google Cloud platform:
			Microsoft Azure:
			Linode
		Advantages:
			We can change ip quickly

C2 Frameworks:(aka Command and Control)(aka CnC)
	Basics:
		It is where we actually interact with the agent
		www.thec2matrix.com
		Types of C2:
			Short-Haul:
				Callback in 1-24hr range
			Long-Haul:
				Callback in  12-24hr range
				Add Jitter to avoid patterns
				Its used to avoid detection by blue-team
