File Inclusion:
==============
File Inclusion can be exploited in many programming languages!
PHP File Inclusion: Read PHP Vulnerabilites sheet
ASP.net File Inclusion:
	Response.WriteFile() => can be used to include file, no code execution
	Server.Execute() => can be used to include file, do code execution. But it is limited to webroot only. (webroot means the base directory where webapp is installed)
JSP File Inclusion:
	<jsp:include page="" /> => can be used to include file, do code execution. But it is limited to webroot only. (webroot means the base directory where webapp is installed)
Somtimes, webapp automatically appeneds .ext:
	Bypass:(for JSP)
		By using a '?' => .ext gets interpreted as a parameter and therefore excluded.
		file=/etc/passwd?
